## Introduction

The [Diversity Cyber Council](https://www.diversitycybercouncil.com/) is a Non-Profit that helps under-represented
demographics in the tech-industry with education, staffing and training opportunities.

The *ClearView* program aims to harness AI to facilitate matches between job candidates and open roles using anonymized
resumes.

Our solution consists of an architecture that is well-equipped to serve a UX application such as this. 
One main contribution was enabling the integration of thousands of HR systems in our platform, 
another was the efficient organisation of the data flows for our reporting and analytics domain.

However, our most important focus was the fulfillment of all AI-related requirements:
The emergence of LLMs with their promise of easy and fast solutions to previously hard to solve problems, 
understandably drives demand for AI based solutions in IT projects.
While there is significant potential in LLMs, there are unique risks to be considered when designing a system whose 
core functionality leverages LLMs:
LLMs are recent and evolve quickly, thus experienced engineers in the field are rare. Furthermore, 
LLM services are expensive to use, however their cost is hard to predict and externally hosted solutions impose 
rate-limits and short model lifecycles. And finally, the inherent bias in LLM models must not leak into the matching 
process since bias is the very thing we seek to control.
Our architecture navigates all these risks and makes the use of LLMs feasible for a Non-Profit organisation such as the 
Diversity Cyber Council. We deliberately save cost in other parts of the architecture in order to mitigate the 
unpredictable price tag of such an AI solution.

### Key Objectives

- **Develop an AI-Powered Matching Platform:** Create an effective system that minimizes bias in the hiring process.
    - Our main contributions for this objective are:
        - Research, such as [interview with an AI-expert](/Requirements/Research/interview-ai-expert.md) and
          [token estimation of a sample prompt](/Requirements/Research/token-estimation.md) leading to many
          [assumptions and requirements](/Requirements/requirements-and-assumptions.md),
        - Matching algorithm considerations, such as [ADR-010](/ADR/ADR-010-create-features-from-story-not-resumes.md)
          and
          [ADR-011, deterministic matching](/ADR/ADR-011-deterministic-matching.md),
          and the corresponding [visualization](/C4/C3-components-matching.md)
        - Other architectural considerations, such as [ADR-006](/ADR/ADR-006-ai-models-run-on-separate-containers.md),
          [ADR-007](/ADR/ADR-007-use-of-external-llms.md)
        - [ADR-025: AI test concept](/ADR/ADR-025-ai-test-concept.md)

- **Analyze Hiring Disparities:** Utilize metrics and surveys to uncover disparities between selected job candidates and
  those who were not hired.
    - Our main contributions for this objective are design decisions such as:
        - [ADR-003](/ADR/ADR-003-batch-for-analytics.md)
        - [ADR-018](/ADR/ADR-018-location-of-survey-triggers.md)
        - [ADR-019](/ADR/ADR-019-data-transmission-for-analytics.md)
        - [ADR-020](/ADR/ADR-020-externalizing-survey-processes.md)

- **Seamless HR Integration:** Implement a streamlined integration with employers' HR systems to ensure a smooth
  interview experience.
    - Our main contributions for this objective are design decisions such as:
        - Asynchronous trigger: [ADR-016](/ADR/ADR-016-matches-published-as-events.md)
        - Fault-tolerant and scalable HR Integration Service: [ADR-023](/ADR/ADR-023-adapters-for-hr-systems.md) and
          its
          [visualization](/C4/C3-components-hr-integration.md)

## Event Storming

We used [Event Storming](./EventStorming/event_storming.md) to explore and map out various domains within our business
processes. The session focused on capturing and documenting the flow of events, actors, and interactions between
systems. This document summarizes our outcomes and serves as a guide to understanding our approach.

## Requirements

Based on the problem description, our [Event Storming](./EventStorming/event_storming.md), and research, we compiled a
list of [functional
and non-functional requirements](/Requirements/requirements-and-assumptions.md) complemented by a set of assumptions.
The requirements and assumptions are numbered and are referenced in the following way:

- Ri (f. ex. [R2](/Requirements/requirements-and-assumptions.md)), for functional requirements
- Qi (f.ex. [Q13](/Requirements/requirements-and-assumptions.md)), for non-functional requirements
- Ai (f. ex. [A22](/Requirements/requirements-and-assumptions.md)) , for assumptions

We typically link to the file, but due to markdown limitations, the specific entry can not be referenced in the link.

The [glossary](/Requirements/glossary.md) defines terms we use.

## Architecture Characteristics
Starting from the [business requirements](/Requirements/requirements-and-assumptions.md) and the [Event Storming](./EventStorming/event_storming.md) we determined the [architecture characteristics](/ArchitectureCharacteristics/Characteristics.md).

The selection of characteristics provides the basis for the selection of an Architectural Type. We selected the
following seven characteristics and focused our attention on the three most important characteristics.

![ArchitecturalCharacteristics](/ArchitectureCharacteristics/images/architecture-characteristics.png)

These driving characteristics significantly influenced our ADRs. The following ADRs were important to realize our
TOP 3 driving characteristics:

- interoperability
  - [ADR-005](/ADR/ADR-005-async-with-external-systems.md)
  - [ADR-007](/ADR/ADR-007-use-of-external-llms.md)
  - [ADR-023](/ADR/ADR-023-adapters-for-hr-systems.md)
- feasibility
  - [ADR-002](/ADR/ADR-002-architecture-style.md)
  - [ADR-007](/ADR/ADR-007-use-of-external-llms.md)
  - [ADR-011](/ADR/ADR-011-deterministic-matching.md)
- testability
  - [ADR-002](/ADR/ADR-002-architecture-style.md)
  - [ADR-011](/ADR/ADR-011-deterministic-matching.md)
  - [ADR-025](/ADR/ADR-025-ai-test-concept.md)

## Architecture style

According to the TOP 3 [driving characteristics](/ArchitectureCharacteristics/Characteristics.md):

- interoperability
- feasibility
- testability

a service-based architecture [ADR-002](/ADR/ADR-002-architecture-style.md) with event-streaming capabilities where
needed, was selected to leverage the optimal balance between feasibility and testability.

## Architecture

By utilizing the [C4](https://c4model.com/) approach to visualize software architecture, we can effectively illustrate
the dependencies between various components of our application while emphasizing hierarchical relationships. Our primary
focus will be on the C1 and C2 views to provide an initial overview, before delving into the C3 view to examine the core
components in greater detail.

### Context diagram (C1)

The context view allows us to get a first grasp of the actors and the external components interacting with the ClearView
system.

![Context diagram (C1)](/C4/images/C4-C1-Context.drawio.svg)

The full Context diagram with the description of the Actors and Systems can be found [here](/C4/C1-context.md).

### Container diagram (C2)

The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are distributed
across it.
It also shows how the containers communicate with each another.

![Container diagram (C2)](/C4/images/C2-Container.png)

The full Container diagram with the descriptions of the containers and ADRs describing the decisions can be
found [here](/C4/C2-container.md).

### Components diagram (C3)

To address the main challenges of this system, we created a components diagram:

- **[Job Candidate Components](/C4/C3-components-job-candidate.md)**: This diagram illustrates how we integrate **Security** and **Testability** into our architecture.
- **[Story Components](/C4/C3-components-story.md)**: This diagram illustrates how we integrate **Data Integrity** and **Testability** into our architecture.
- **[Matching Components](/C4/C3-components-matching.md)**: This diagram illustrates how we integrate **Scalability** and **Testability** into our architecture.
- **[HR Integration Components](/C4/C3-components-hr-integration.md)**: This diagram illustrates how we integrate **Interoperability** and **Fault Tolerance** into our architecture.

An interaction of the Containers and Components is documented in the Use
Case: [Upload and Publish a Resume](/UseCases/use-case-upload-a-resume.md)

## Known Limitations

The current architecture has the following limitations:

- **Matching Algorithm Limitations**:  
  The matching algorithm utilizes a predefined set of human-readable features, as described
  in [ADR-011](/ADR/ADR-011-deterministic-matching.md). Defining these features comprehensively for all S.M.A.R.T
  stories and open roles can be challenging.

- **Delayed Matching Process**:  
  Matching is executed as a periodic background process rather than in real-time, as detailed
  in [ADR-008](/ADR/ADR-008-ui-reactivity.md).

- **External AI Service Rate Limiting**:  
  Since AI services run independently as external entities, as described
  in [ADR-007](/ADR/ADR-007-use-of-external-llms.md), and these services introduce hard rate-limits,
  tracking and control of traffic will be required for reliability as well as cost-control.
  If the traffic pattern across all LLM clients needs to be known, the combination of all clients into one container
  will need to be considered.

- **User Administration**:  
  User administration through the UI is not yet part of the current concept and is dependent on initial technology
  decisions, such as the presence of existing Identity Providers (IdPs) at Diversity Cyber Council. For more
  information, see [ADR-022](/ADR/ADR-022-initial-technology-decisions.md). The current approach is to use a local user
  account that has access to the Identity Provider's UI.
