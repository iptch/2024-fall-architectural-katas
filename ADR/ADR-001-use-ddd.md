# ADR-001: Use Domain Driven Design

## Date:
2024-09-23

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
We have a limited amount of time to get to an initial architecture for the ClearView system.

## Decision:
We use [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) to get a common understanding of the business problem at hand.

## Consequences:
- A common understanding is created
- A lot of time is spent on DDD, which might be missing otherwise
